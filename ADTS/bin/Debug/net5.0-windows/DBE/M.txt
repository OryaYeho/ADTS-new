A man in his 20s has died after falling out of a hot air balloon and hitting a car on Route 60 near Afula.
Magen David Adom paramedics found the man with no signs of life and determined his death on the spot.
The victim was reportedly a member of the hot air balloon crew who had been left dangling off the side as it lifted off, but they had risen so quickly that it was impossible for them to stop, Walla reported.
Photos on Israeli news websites showed him in mid-air, clutching the red-and-white basket. Police said he fell from a height of about 100 meters (330 ft).
Police and the Civil Aviation Authority have opened an investigation into the incident.
Cpl. Slava Bonchuk said that the pilot had explained some of the circumstances behind the incident.
"Apparently the crew member who died was supposed to be on the ground, not in the air," Bonchuk told ynet, adding that the crew member was well-known in the area. "People are in shock. This is a very difficult case."
