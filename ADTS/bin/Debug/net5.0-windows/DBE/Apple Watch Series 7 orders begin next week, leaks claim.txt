Two different apparent leaks have stated that preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 will begin next week and that the wearable will ship the following week.

Jon Prosser, a leaker with a long track record on Apple products, wrote on Front Page Tech that "multiple sources familiar with the release" have said that preorders would begin "as soon as next week, with shipping happening mid-October."
And as reported first by AppleTrack, an email blast to customers from luxury brand Herm√®s (which makes Apple Watch-related products) got more specific: it named the first day to order the Watch. "The Apple Watch Series 7 will be available for preorder beginning October 8, 2021," the brief email said.

Last month, Apple hosted a product-unveiling video-stream that detailed several of 2021's new iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch models for the first time. While the iPhones and iPads were given release dates, Apple simply said the Watch would be "available later this fall."

Apple has revealed the new flagship iPhones and updated Apple Watch wearables side by side at an event in mid-September for multiple years in a row now, but it was unusual for the company to not use that platform to announce a launch date for one of those products. In the lead-up to the event, various reports claimed that supply chain challenges might affect Apple products this year, the Watch included.

The Apple Watch Series 7 offers a subtle redesign over its immediate predecessor, with a bigger screen. It also features a faster chip and more durable materials. Overall, it's a modest annual refresh of the device, with no major new features.

A recent report from The Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with Apple's plans to claim that next year's watch will receive new health-tracking features that were not included this time around.
