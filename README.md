This project was implemented as part of a bachelor's project, in a research track.
The goal of this research is to develop an algorithm that will help us to distribute documents using a similarity level between a document and a category. At first, the user has to define some categories and assign documents to them. The system updates the words it saves, which in turn affects the similarity level and thus makes it a learning system.
